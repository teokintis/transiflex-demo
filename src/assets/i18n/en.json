Especially if we include the variations on how poker is played in different parts of the world, such as the case of poka in Greece or Chinese Poker, which is super-popular in Asia. The winning hands and strategy also vary depending on where and with whom the game is played, but the diversity and variety that poker offers is the main reason why it is so beloved around the world. At its core, however, the game has some basic rules that you need to know, regardless of the variant you will play.",
      "pokerIntroductionTitle": "How to play Poker",
      "pokerIntroductionText": "Studying how Poker is played in the different variations of the game, we will discover that there are some basic rules. Rules that do not change, regardless of geography or name of the game. For example, Poker is always played with one deck, whether you play Hold'Em or Omaha. And the ranking of the cards based on their strength is almost the same everywhere. Although in some very rare cases, we have found tables that had unusual rules, especially for chop pot, the card-ranking of the kicker card and the winner based on the strength of the card. The big debate, however, and one of the reasons why those who invented the game's rules deal with it differently from country to country, is whether poker is a game of luck or not. There is no doubt that there are better players than others, who over time are becoming winning players. And that alone says a lot about the nature of poker and how decisive luck is in it.",

      "pokerRulesText1": "The discussion about the rules of Poker for all its variations is a never-ending story. That's why we will set as ground rules the rules of Texas Hold'Em, the most popular type of Poker, to explain the specifics of the game.",
      "pokerRulesText2": "Up to 10 people can sit at the table. Although most tables both in casinos and online poker are for 6 or 9 players. While there are also Heads-up tables, where two players play against each other.",
      "pokerRulesText3": "The goal of the game is for the player to form a strong hand, which is stronger than any other on the table. What a strong hand is will be reviewed later in our text. To form the player's hand, they will first receive two closed cards from the dealer and will need to use some (or even all) of the cards that are shared openly on the table (Community Cards).",
      "pokerRulesText4": "The game begins when the cards are dealt by the dealer starting from the player to their right. This player has placed a small bet (Small Blind), while the next player to the right has placed double that amount (Big Blind). The role of the Blinds in Poker is to ensure that not everyone folds and that there is some action in all hands. Once players receive two closed cards each, the first betting round begins.

Once all players have made their move, it is the dealer's turn to start dealing the community cards. Players can use these cards according to what they have been previously dealt in order to form strong hands. The community cards will be revealed in three streets, each followed by a corresponding round of betting. These stages are:",

In some cases, it is not unlikely that the cards in hand are so bad that players will need to use the 5 open cards of the table. The final street follows. Here, players, having seen the cards being played on the table and having studied the behaviour of their opponents, are called to decide whether to go all-in more dynamically. If a player is left alone at the table, i.e. if all the others fold, then he wins the pot. But if other players have remained, then these must show their cards, starting with the one who \"spoke\" first in this round. If the remaining players who \"speak\" after him realise that they have lost the game, they may not even open their cards. The same applies to the player who wins while all the others at the table have gone all-in. Either way, the player who wins in both cases will take the entire pot that has been accumulated.",

The Europeans who immigrated to America brought the game to the New World, where it eventually came to dominate casino and internet gaming from the 20th century onwards.",

          "question": "Are the cards you are dealt at the start of a poker hand the only determining factor in the game?",
          "answer": "No, not at all. Of course, these cards play a fundamental role in determining who wins and who loses but poker is not just about these cards. The decisions made by players, including tactical betting, are equally important part of the game. Good cards will help you win, but skilled players can find ways to win even if they don't have a good starting hand."

          "question": "What is the best type of poker to play?",
          "answer": "There are several different versions of poker and none of them can be considered as \"the best\". However, most beginners start playing Texas Hold'em. It is the most popular form of the game today and one of the easiest to learn. Once you're comfortable with Texas Hold'em, you can easily start learning the other versions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between fixed limit and no limit?",
          "answer": "Limit and No Limit are two different betting structures in poker. There are some other variations as well but these two dominate the space. The betting structure essentially sets the betting limits for each player when it is their turn at the table. In fixed limit poker, a player can only bet or raise a predetermined amount. In no limit, however, a player can bet or raise any amount they want, which of course is limited by their chip stack."

        {
          "question": "Which Poker Games can I play online?",
          "answer": "All popular poker variations are available online. Texas Hold’em is by far the most popular and widely played. But most online sites offer a variety of choices including Omaha, Razz, Seven Card Stud and some other mixed formats."
